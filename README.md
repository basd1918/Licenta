I proposed the development of a mobile app to facilitate the calculation and the payment of the maintenance but also the efficient management of the expenses made by the association. 

Application functionalities:

• Adding, deleting and modifying an apartment;

• View the list of apartments and details about them;

• Efficient maintenance calculation;

• Sending the maintenance table to tenants by e-mail;

• Prompt payment of maintenance;

• View all expenses;

• Deleting and modifying an administration expense;

• Filtering the maintenance list by date;

• Expenditure statistics for each apartment in the form of a graph
